This project contains examples showing how to use the ECLogging framework.

The project contains two application targets, one each for Mac and iOS, which each illustrate how to perform logging, and how to display a UI to configure it.

The project also contains two unit test targets, again Mac and iOS, which illustrate how to use ECLogging's unit test support.


Dependencies
------------

For this project to build, it needs to be able to find ECLogging.framework.

The best way to do this is to create a worksheet, and add both this project and the [ECLogging project](https://github.com/elegantchaos/ECLogging) to it.

Alternatively, you can check out the [ECIntegration project](https://github.com/elegantchaos/ECIntegration), which includes compatible versions of all of the EC frameworks as submodules.
